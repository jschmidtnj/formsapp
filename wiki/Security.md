## Security measures

Since this website is to be used in a major company, and only users inside the company are to create forms and workflows, a custom database rule was used so that only users with email address domains from inside the corporation can create and edit forms. There is therefore no security risk from an attacker outside the company to access sensitive response data, or change forms at will, since they are blocked from ever accessing this data. However, anyone inside the company with the correct information and javascript can access this data. This is one of the main problems with having client-side database writes. It is therefore necessary for users who were terminated from the company to have their accounts suspended through cloud functions such as the `accountcleanup` function, to prevent these people from logging in again and being malicious.
